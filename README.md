# Java-Mirrored_RightAngled_Triangle_Patterns
This Java program prints a mirrored right-angled triangle using spaces and asterisks (*). It starts with 3 spaces and 1 star, decreasing spaces and increasing stars in each row. The outer loop runs 4 times (i=0 to i=3). The first inner loop prints spaces, and the second prints stars, forming a right-aligned triangle pattern.
